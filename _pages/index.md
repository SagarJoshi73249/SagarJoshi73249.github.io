## **About Me**

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by how things work. Whether it was taking apart gadgets at home or sketching ideas for imaginary machines, I always felt drawn to the mechanics behind everyday objects. That curiosity naturally led me to engineering, where I discovered my passion for **robotics, design, and manufacturing**. To me, engineering is more than just equations and simulations—it’s about solving real-world problems in creative and efficient ways.

My journey has taken me from **Mumbai to Los Angeles**, where I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Mechanical Engineering** at the **University of Southern California**. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of working on **cutting-edge research in robotics**, designing **intelligent systems**, and collaborating with brilliant minds across different fields. What excites me the most is the intersection of **mechanical design, automation, and artificial intelligence**, and how these fields can come together to push the boundaries of innovation.

Beyond engineering, I love working on **hands-on projects**—whether it’s building a smart system, prototyping a new mechanism, or optimizing an existing design. There’s something incredibly rewarding about turning an abstract idea into something tangible. I believe the best solutions emerge at the crossroads of **technical expertise, creativity, and curiosity**.

### **Currently Looking for Full-Time Opportunities**
I am actively seeking **full-time positions in Robotics and Mechanical Engineering**, where I can apply my skills in **robotics, automation, and manufacturing** to real-world challenges. If you're looking for someone who brings a mix of **technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a passion for innovation**, let’s connect!
