## **About Me**

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by how things work. Whether it was taking apart gadgets at home or sketching ideas for imaginary machines, I always felt drawn to the mechanics behind everyday objects. That curiosity naturally led me to engineering, where I discovered my passion for robotics, design, and manufacturing. To me, engineering is more than just equations and simulations, it’s about solving real-world problems in creative and efficient ways.

My journey has taken me from Mumbai to Los Angeles, where I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Southern California. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of working on cutting-edge research in robotics, designing intelligent systems, and collaborating with brilliant minds across different fields. What excites me the most is the intersection of mechanical design, automation, and artificial intelligence, and how these fields can come together to push the boundaries of innovation.

### **Currently Looking for Full-Time Opportunities**
