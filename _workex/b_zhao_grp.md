üìç Los Angeles, CA | üóì **September 2023 ‚Äì January 2024**  

### **Overview**
At the Zhao Research Group, my research focused on the development of **soft stretchable electromyography (EMG) sensors** for **muscle signal acquisition**. Traditional EMG sensors often struggle with **flexibility and adhesion**, limiting their usability in **real-world biomechanical applications**.  

My work aimed to **bridge this gap** by designing a **next-generation soft sensor** that is:
- **Highly flexible**
- **Capable of conforming to human skin**
- **Enhanced with a micro-needle array** for improved signal clarity

### **Engineering the Sensor**
The novel **serpentine-patterned micro-needle array** was:
‚úî Optimized for **UV resin 3D printing**.  
‚úî Designed for **maximized adhesion** while maintaining **stretchability**.  
‚úî Tested across various **muscle groups** to measure **bioelectric signals** accurately.

### **Key Contributions**
- Designed an **innovative micro-needle pattern** to enhance **EMG signal acquisition**.
- Optimized **resin 3D printing parameters** to improve material flexibility.
- Validated the sensor in **real-world conditions**, ensuring its applicability in **wearable medical devices**.

This research contributes to the **future of soft, wearable bioelectronics** for **health monitoring and rehabilitation**.
